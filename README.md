Devoxx France 2016 template

### What is this repository for? ###

This repo stores various Devoxx France 2016 presentation templates.

### How do I contribute ###

If you want to create your own Devoxx France 2016, we'd like that you use our guidelines, fonts and logo so that we can offer a consolidated experience to our attendees

### What is the Devoxx France 2016 Theme ? ### 

Gears, gears, gears.

From the sponsor brochure to our web site, through the tee-shirt, we created a new theme around Gears. For French, the tagline will be "L'ensemble de nos passions". You can try to translate this to "The sum of all our passions".

### What is the recommended format ? ### 

Almost all presentations are recorded. Your presentation will be available few weeks after Devoxx France 2016 on the Youtube Devoxx channel.
