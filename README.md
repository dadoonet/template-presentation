As an inspiration, we included a PDF version of our Keynote template, so that you can get an idea of what it could looks like.

If you want to create your own Devoxx France 2017, we'd like that you use our guidelines, fonts and logo so that we can offer a consolidated experience to our attendees.

### What is the recommended format? 

Almost all presentations are recorded. Your presentation will be available few weeks after Devoxx France 2017 on the Youtube Devoxx channel. 

We recommend that you keep the 16/9 ratio format for optimal display.

This year we record your laptop video output directly and thus we won't need PDF or your slides after the presentation. Feel free to use any presentation technologies, but try to follow our guidelines and the color chart.

Devoxx France are not mandatory. If you prefer to use your own presentation, do it. Please insert a first slide with the Devoxx France 2017 theme, then keep your presentation as it is. Always remember : your presentation is recorded. 

Thanks
