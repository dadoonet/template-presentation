### What is the Devoxx France 2023 Theme?  

The main background image was generated by Nicolas Martignole using DALL-E during Devoxx Belgium 2022. The prompt 
that was used is the following : 

```The year is 2050, we see a view of Paris with modern public transportation, a steam-punk ballon and 2 drones,  as a Jules Vernes poster```


### What is the recommended format for the templates? 

Almost all presentations are recorded during Devoxx France. Your presentation will be available few weeks after Devoxx France on the [Youtube Devoxx channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsVPQfo5RZErDL41LoWvk0A) 

We recommend that you keep the 16/9 ratio format for optimal display.
Devoxx France are not mandatory. If you prefer to use your own presentation, do it.
However please insert a first slide with the Devoxx France theme, then keep your presentation as it is. Always remember : your presentation is recorded. 

Last but not least, we also have a code of conduct on the Devoxx France web site.

Thanks
