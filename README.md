### What is the Devoxx France 2021 Theme?  

The theme for 2021 is "happy to be all together"

### What is the recommended format for the templates? 

Almost all presentations are recorded during Devoxx France. Your presentation will be available few weeks after Devoxx France on the [Youtube Devoxx channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsVPQfo5RZErDL41LoWvk0A) 

We recommend that you keep the 16/9 ratio format for optimal display.

This year we record your laptop video output directly and thus we won't need PDF or your slides after the presentation. Feel free to use any presentation technologies, but try to follow our guidelines and the color chart.

Devoxx France are not mandatory. If you prefer to use your own presentation, do it.

However please insert a first slide with the Devoxx France theme, then keep your presentation as it is. Always remember : your presentation is recorded. 

Last but not least, we also have a code of conduct on the Devoxx France web site.

Thanks
